# Bento 

Bento is a Game development starter kit for javascript.

- ES6/7/8
- Latest babel language features
- doesn't get in your way, just start coding

## Installation

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install 
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

open up your web browser and visit `localhost:8080` to see the site live in action.

If you just want to build your project run 
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `public` directory containing a `main.bundle.js` file which you can serve in your application.

The development server will watch for file changes in your codebase and reload the browser.

## TODO

- [] support for SASS compilation
